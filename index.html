                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            I was born and raised in Provo, Utah by my amazing parents, Brian and Julie Holman. Their work ethic and love influenced me to work hard at my goals. I have a deep appreciation and love for my family members.
                            They have made me who I am today. Through the influence of those around me, I eventually developed 
                            a love for tennis. It is an area in which you could say, I "thrive". I love to be outdoors especially in my hammock, and have recently developed a love for travelling. I am an Experience Design
                            and Management student at Brigham Young University because I believe that people don't live their lives enough. There are so many opportunities that are missed because we are scared to do something 
                            new. My goal is to help people learn to live meaningful lives dedicated to things that will actually bring them fulfillment. Among these many factors, I believe service, faith, pursuit of passion, 
                            and experiences are what make a meaningful life.

                            <!-- <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">I am studying Experience Design and Management at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah. Though I was previously 
                                an accounting major, I realized after returning home from an 18 month mission for my Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, 
                                that I wanted to do something that was going to bring fullfillment into my life and the lives of others. I hope to apply to the program in June. 
                                Though the actual education I have been receiving at BYU has blessed me immensely, my true gratitude for being able to attend this University
                                stems from my ability to merge religion and academics and being able to meet so many incredible people. 
                                Previous to my time at BYU, I spent my teenage years at Provo High School and graduated with a diploma.  -->

                                        serving the Lord by going out every day to find those ready to hear the message we had to share, which was that of the 
                                        Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. I learned what true 
                                        devotion truly means. I learned how to focus my mind and allow for stillness. One of the greatest lessons I learned 
                                        as a missionary was the value of hard work. Few things will bring more joy than good old elbow grease.

                                        service and returned back to work in January of 2025. I have learned crucial life skills such as effective communication, problem solving under
                                        time constraints, deescalating situations, and many additional lessons. I recently accepted the position to be the Employee
